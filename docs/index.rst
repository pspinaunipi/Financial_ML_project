Welcome to our project documentation
====================================
For our project we joined a competition on kaggle in which we needed to use
machine learning algorithms, able to decide whether or not to accept a stock trade.
Since this is a very complex environment, simpler algorithms would have not given us
good performances and for this reason we decided to focus our attention on bagging
and boosting algorithms. We compared 4 different classifiers, while testing various
feature selection and missing data imputation techniques. All the algorithms we used
are implemented in the sklearn and xgboost python libraries.
